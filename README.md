# Gameboy Emulator
This repo contains the source code for the Nintendo Gameboy Emulator I developed in C++/SFML in March-May 2020. This program simulates the internals of a Nintendo Gameboy at the level of individual bytes, allowing vintage games to be played on a modern computer. The working title during development was `Gameboi`.

This project uses SMFL as a graphics/audio library - SFML must be installed in order to run properly

Source code is contained in the `Gameboi` folder
